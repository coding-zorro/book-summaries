# Ahead in the Cloud

Cloud computing is the provisioning of IT resources over the Internet on a pay per use model. 

There are usually four stages of cloud adoption -
1. **Projects**<br>
Identifying the right projects for the initial migration, ones which are valuable to business and also has a high learning potential.
2. **Foundation**<br>
Create a cross functional and cross organizational team which can create (cloud-first)reference architectures and continuous deployment tools which interests business units to adopt them.
3. **Migration**
- Five phases of the migration process:<br>
    - *Opportunity evaluation* - Business case for migration
    - *Portfolio discovery and planning* - Understand the current environment and its dependencies better
    - *Application design* - Move the focus of the migration to the individual application and use the six strategies of migration applications
    - *Migration and Validation* - Have a strategy of continuous improvement and starting with a low complex application for migration and strategy for testing
    - *Modern Operating model* - Iterate towards a more modern operating model(set of people, process and technology)
- Six Strategies for migrating applications:
    - *Rehosting* - Lift and Shift. Good for steady state applications or making the initial move to Cloud before re-architecting them to be more cloud native.
    - *Replatforming* - Lift, Tinker and Shift
    - *Repurchasing* - Move to a SaaS platform
    - *Re-architecting* - Rebuild using cloud-native components/technologies
    - *Retire* - Get rid of the application
    - *Retain* - Do nothing or revisit later

4. **Reinvention**<br>
Continuous improvement or optimization of applications or the portfolio after their migration to the cloud.<br><br>

**Seven best practices** -
1. Provide executive support
2. Educate staff
3. Create a culture of experimentation
4. Pick the right partners
5. Create a Cloud center of excellence
6. Implement a hybrid architecture
7. Implement a cloud first strategy

**Provide Executive support**<br>
- *Merging Business and Technology* - Get the buy-in from peers in the Executive group by illustrating the business value of migrating to the cloud.
- *Providing clarity of purpose* - Communicate the purpose clearly to everyone. This separates the great leaders from the good ones.
- *Making new roles* - Make new roles when the old rules no longer apply.

**Educate staff**<br>
- Starting with something meaningful, but basic
- Leverage AWS training
- Give your teams time to experiment
- Set goals that encourage learning and experimentation
- Set time constraints and pace yourselves
- Spot and deal with change resistance
- Don't be afraid to give people new roles
- Show your staff how they fit into the bigger picture
- Go to industry events and see what others are doing
- Learn from your partners
- Institutionalize your own flavor of training in your organization

**Create a culture of experimentation**<br>
- Do manage expectations
- Do encourage your teams to propose experiments
- Do consider DevOps to institutionalize experimentations
- Do encourage the whole organization to participate
- Don't start with a project where everyone is set on a specific outcome
- Don't pursue an experiment until you know how to measure it
- Don't doubt your team
- Don't let experiments slow or halt delivery

**Pick the right partners**<br>
- Leverage the fast growing ecosystem of partners and find the right partners in your focus areas
- Assimilate culture(such as customer focus, cloud first and DevOps) from the partners
- AWS has setup the following programs to provide a set of best practices for large scale cloud operations and periodically audits them-
    - AWS Managed Services Program
    - AWS DevOps Competency

**Create a cloud center of excellence**<br>
- Build the team small with engineers from diverse backgrounds and grow it's size and responsibilities over time.
- CCoE should be responsible for best practices, governance, frameworks and reference architectures
- This rest of the organization should be leveraging them to transform their business using the cloud.
- DevOps considerations-
    - Be a customer(internal & external) service oriented throughout the organization
    - Automate everything
    - Run what you build
        - Engineers will have to design for production
        - Greater employee autonomy as it encourages ownership and accountability
        - Greater transparency in monitoring and proactive alerting
        - Better operational quality

**Implement a hubrid architecture**<br>
In their cloud journey, companies extend their on-premise infrastructure with AWS to create a hybrid architecture. Some myths about hybrid architectures-
- Hybrid is a permanent destination
- Hybrid allows applications to seamlessly move between on-premise infrastructure and the cloud
- Hybrid allows applications to be build to work cross multiple cloud providers. The best approach to break vendor lock-in is to use automation to decouple the application and its infrastructure.

**Implement a cloud first strategy**<br>
- Cloud first strategy impacts many departments of the organization, so everyone should be included as a stakeholder
- Cloud first strategy should be declared after acquiring experience in cloud and after maturity.
- Different organizations in a company can be at different stages of the cloud journey and can adopt the cloud first strategy at different times.
