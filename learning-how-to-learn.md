# Learning how to learn

- When you start a new chapter, go on a picture walk. Check out the pictures, the headings and captions. It gives your brain an idea of what's coming.
- There are two ways of thinking that we need to alternate between to learn well:
    - Focused mode: That's when you pay close attention
    - Diffused mode: That's when your mind is not thinking anything in particular. 
- The diffused mode helps you make imaginative connections between ideas and creativity pops out. So take breaks to get new problem solving perspectives.
- Stop procrastinating. Its stressful. Just get started on the activity and that will make it easier after sometime.
- Use the Pomodoro technique: Shutdown all distractions and focus for 25 minutes and reward yourself at the end.
- Active Recall: Actively recall key ideas that you are learning so that it sticks in your memory better and becomes a great way to learn them better.
- The Three key steps to powerful reading:
    - Picture walk
    - Read slowly with care
    - Use active recall
- The brain is made of billions of neurons which forms links with each other through small electrical shocks. Learning and practicing makes these links stronger. The neurons are like a clay mold and new brain links can be formed. This is called neuroplasticity.
- Metaphors help in the learning process because of *neural reuse theory* as the new learning will be based on brain links formed due to metophors, which we can easily connect with already.
