# Harvard Business Review Leader's Handbook

**What is leadership?**<br>
Achieving significant positive impact - by building an organization of people working together toward a common goal.

## Developing a strategy

*Strategy* is a coordinated set of actions that organizations follow to win or attain their vision. Its also much about what the leaders decide not to do.

Common pitfalls of strategy -

- Set the stage
    - Purpose should be clearly defined
    - Identify the audience and stakeholders

- Set strategic goals
- Understand the current situation
    - Identify key issues and problems to solve
- Develop options for **Where** and **how** to compete. 
    - best strategies develop offerings that target an unique and defensible sweet spot
- Assess options, engage stakeholders and move towards decisions
- Allocate resources and manage implementation
    - Focus investment
    - Communicate clearly
    - Keep learning, keep adapting

Five tests for strategy -

## Getting great people on board<br>
**Social Contract**<br>
People join organizations voluntarily and give their best efforts for the collective success of the organization and expect good compensation, growth, job satisfaction and relationships. The leader is expected to honor both sides of this social contract and maintain a balance between the interests of the people and the organization. <br><br>

- Harnessing Performance feedback
    - Give constructive, candid and timely feedback. Otherwise, people won't know whether their efforts are working or not.
    - Leaders giving feedback is critical as it sets the tone for feedback and learning throughout the organization.
    - Few principles-
        - Feedback is a business activity(not personal) thats important for the health of the organization.
        - Frame the feedback discussion as a problem solving exercise, instead of telling them to do differently.

    - Everyone in the organization need to know this philosophy and how it applies to them.
- Shaping a culture of executing your strategy
    - Sum of attitudes, beliefs, customs and behaviours shaped over time.
    - The culture should be aligned with the vision and strategy

        - As part of career development, ask your top talents to act on the cultural goals.
        - People exhibit the desired cultural behaviours when they see them to be rewarded and recognized.

## Focusing on results
- When the high performance and results are the only expected outcome, its makes the team and the leaders think and work differently and discover new opportunities which wouldn't have been the case otherwise.
- Four elements the create a focus on results:
    - Setting high performance goals
        - the ability to establish high performance expectations may be the most universally underdeveloped leadership skill
        - High performance is only possible when the expectations are ratcheted up
    - Holding people accountable
        - Evaluate people based on the results, not for effort. Otherwise it becomes acceptable to try hard and deliver only mediocre results.
        - Help people overcome the barriers in their work
    - Reducing organization complexity. Examples are-
        - Organizational or Structural design that get in the way of getting things done
        - Product proliferation
        - Outdated processes
        - Managerial behaviors that get in the way
    - Building capabilities while growing results
        - Most effective change in organizations comes from bottom up experiments in an iterative process
        - Managers and their people learn new capabilities and experience success
        - Spread the new approaches to others.
    -  Maintaining organizational discipline
        - Get the right metrics
            - Are we focusing on the right questions
            - Does our data tell a story
            - Does our data help us to look ahead rather than behind
            - Do we have a mix of quantitative and qualitative data
        - Set an operational review cadence
        - Lead a candid dialogue at operational reviews
            - Ask tough and direct questions
            - Ask questions that forces people to think differently+
