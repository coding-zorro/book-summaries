## **Simplicity & Design Principles**

1. **Don’t Overengineer the Solution** — Keep systems as simple as possible. Complexity makes scaling, debugging, and maintaining much harder.
2. **Design Scale into the Solution (D-I-D Process)** — Build scalability into the design early rather than retrofitting later. It’s much cheaper to plan for growth from day one.
3. **Simplify the Solution Three Times Over** — After designing, look for unnecessary parts and cut them. Then repeat the exercise until only essentials remain.
4. **Use the Right Tools** — Match technology to the problem instead of forcing one-size-fits-all. The wrong tool creates bottlenecks.
5. **Be Competent** — Teams must understand both the business and the technology. Poor decisions often come from lack of knowledge.
6. **Learn from Instinct and Measurement** — Data-driven metrics guide decisions. But don’t ignore team intuition and experience.
7. **Always Prioritize Rules by Risk vs. Cost** — Not every rule matters equally. Focus on high-impact, low-cost improvements first.
8. **Continuously Review and Refine the Rules** — Technology evolves, so rules need updates. Regular reviews keep practices relevant.
9. **Use Rules as Organizational Standards** — These rules work best when adopted company-wide. Consistency builds scalable cultures.

## Caching & Performance**

10. **Use Caching Aggressively** — Cache results at every layer: browser, CDN, app, and DB. Fewer requests mean faster systems.
11. **Cache Ajax Calls** — Many API responses don’t change often. Cache them to reduce server load and latency.
12. **Cache Page Responses** — Full-page caching speeds up delivery dramatically. It’s especially effective for content that doesn’t change often.
13. **Use External Cache Stores (e.g., Memcached, Redis)** — Keep cache outside your app servers. This makes it sharable and scalable.
14. **Use Distributed Cache for State** — Shared caches like Redis scale better than in-memory sessions. They also allow failover.
15. **Implement Expires and Cache-Control Headers** — Let browsers and CDNs cache intelligently. This cuts traffic back to your origin.

## **Application Architecture & Patterns**

16. **Design to Clone or Replicate Things (X-axis)** — Add more identical nodes to share load. Cloning provides redundancy and increases throughput.
17. **Design to Split Different Things (Y-axis)** — Break services by functionality. This isolates workloads and prevents one heavy service from overwhelming the whole system.
18. **Use Scale Cube Axes Thoughtfully** — Clone (X), split by service (Y), or partition data (Z). Apply the right dimension for your problem.
19. **Design Scale-Out Solutions, Not Scale-Up** — Use more machines instead of bigger ones. Horizontal scaling is cheaper and more resilient.
20. **Avoid or Distribute State** — Stateless systems scale more easily. If state is necessary, spread it across multiple nodes.
21. **Avoid Putting Systems in Series** — Don’t chain too many dependencies. Each extra step risks slowing or breaking the flow.
22. **Relax Temporal Constraints** — Not everything needs to be real-time. Async processing eases pressure on systems.
23. **Communicate Asynchronously** — Decouple producers and consumers using async messages. This makes the system more resilient to slowdowns.
24. **Ensure You Can Wire On / Wire Off Features Dynamically** — Toggle features without redeploying. This reduces downtime and risk.

## **Database & Storage**

25. **Don’t Duplicate Your Work** — Avoid recalculating or duplicating results unnecessarily. Reuse computations, cache them, or centralize logic.
26. **Avoid Select \* Queries** — Pulling unnecessary fields wastes bandwidth and CPU. Always fetch only what you need.
27. **Don’t Use Database Cursors** — Cursors hold locks and slow performance. Use pagination or batch queries instead.
28. **Do Not Use Multiphase/Two-Phase Commits** — Distributed commits add latency and fragility. Favor eventual consistency when possible.
29. **Use Appropriate Database Locks (Row, Page, Table)** — Match lock granularity to the workload. Too coarse locks block too much; too fine locks add overhead.
30. **Segregate Program and Data** — Don’t mix application logic with data storage. This separation improves maintainability and resilience.
31. **Be Careful with Costly Relationships** — Complex joins are expensive. Normalize carefully but denormalize where performance demands it.

## **Messaging & Event Systems**

32. **Ensure Message Buses Can Scale** — Design messaging systems to handle spikes. Otherwise, they become chokepoints.
33. **Avoid Overcrowding the Message Bus** — Don’t flood the bus with unnecessary chatter. Group or filter events to keep throughput high.

## **Failure & Resilience**

34. **Learn Aggressively from Mistakes** — Treat every failure as an opportunity. Document lessons so they aren’t repeated.
35. **Don’t Rely on QA to Find Mistakes** — Quality starts with developers. Automated tests and peer reviews prevent problems earlier.
36. **Design for Rollback** — Assume some changes will fail in production. Always have a quick way to roll them back.
37. **Discuss Failures — Don’t Blame** — Blameless postmortems help teams improve. Fear-driven cultures hide issues instead of fixing them.
38. **Fail Fast—And Gracefully** — Detect failures quickly to avoid cascading problems. Always degrade in a way users can tolerate.
39. **Avoid Single Points of Failure** — One failure should never bring everything down. Use redundancy and failover strategies.

## **Networking & Delivery**

40. **Reduce DNS Lookups** — Each DNS query adds latency. Minimize them to improve response times.
41. **Reduce Objects Where Possible** — Too many assets (CSS, JS, images) slow the site. Consolidate or remove unnecessary ones.
42. **Use Homogeneous Networks** — Standardize hardware and software across nodes. This reduces failure points and makes scaling predictable.
43. **Design Scale into the Network Hardware** — Hardware should grow with load. Choose scalable load balancers, switches, and routers.
44. **Be Wary of Scaling with Third Parties** — External providers may limit your scale. Design fallback strategies if they fail.

## **Logging, Security & Ops**

45. **Firewalls Everywhere** — Assume every boundary needs protection. Multiple layers of defense reduce risk.
46. **Actively Use Log Files** — Logs are not just for storage. Analyze them to detect issues early and improve performance.
47. **Don’t Check What You Just Wrote** — Re-reading data right after writing wastes cycles. Trust your write unless there’s a real reason to verify.

---

## **State Management**

48. **Avoid Session State on the Server** — Server sessions block horizontal scaling. Store state in the client or a shared service.
49. **Use Browser-Stored State (e.g., Cookies, Local Storage)** — Push safe state management to the client. This reduces server overhead.
50. **Use Distributed Cache for State** — Shared caches like Redis scale better than in-memory sessions. They also allow failover.
