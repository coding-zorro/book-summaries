# Harvard Business Review Leader's Handbook

**What is leadership?**<br>
Achieving significant positive impact - by building an organization of people working together toward a common goal.

People who can add leadership capabilities to their management repertoire will multiply their value many times over. Leaders are able to have a greater impact over time than managers. The best way to develop the leadership skills and knowledge is by live practice - doing and learning on the job.

Must do practices that differentiate leaders -
- Buildifying an unifying vision
- Developing a strategy
- Getting great people on board
- Focussing on the results
- Innovating for the future
- Leading yourself

## Building a unifying vision
What is a Vision?
- Aspiration of what the organization wants to achieve.
- Gives everyone in the organization a sense of purpose
- Simple and emotional
- Provides context for strategy and goal setting.

Challenges in creating a vision -
- Timing has to be correct
- Has to be a bold vision
- Coherence with colleagues
- Takes time to create a compelling vision
- Alignment with the larger enterprise's vision

**Mission**<br>
The reason for an organization's existence.<br>
**Values**<br>
The operating guidelines for how organizational members behave.

## Developing a strategy

*Strategy* is a coordinated set of actions that organizations follow to win or attain their vision. Its also much about what the leaders decide not to do.

Common pitfalls of strategy -
- Incorrectly assessing an external market situation
- Misjudging internal capability
- Sudden changes in trends or ecosystem.

Process to create a strategy -
- Set the stage
    - Purpose should be clearly defined
    - Identify the audience and stakeholders
    - Identify the scope, constraints and implementation implications
    - **Don't do Strategy alone**. Involve as many stakeholders as possible, this helps in removing bias and get more perspectives.
- Set strategic goals
- Understand the current situation
    - Identify key issues and problems to solve
- Develop options for **Where** and **how** to compete. 
    - best strategies develop offerings that target an unique and defensible sweet spot
- Assess options, engage stakeholders and move towards decisions
- Allocate resources and manage implementation
    - Focus investment
    - Communicate clearly
    - Keep learning, keep adapting

Five tests for strategy -
- Has a distinctive value proposition
- Has a tailored value chain
- Trade-offs that enable differentiation from rivals
- Strategic fit
- Continuity over time

## Getting great people on board<br>
**Social Contract**<br>
People join organizations voluntarily and give their best efforts for the collective success of the organization and expect good compensation, growth, job satisfaction and relationships. The leader is expected to honor both sides of this social contract and maintain a balance between the interests of the people and the organization. <br><br>
Five elements-
- Assembling your leadership team
    - Recruit the right leaders. 
        - Two important skills to look for in leaders - Emotional intelligence and Adaptability
        - Get a mix and match of talents with diverse backgrounds and thought processes.
        - Get people who can fill your gaps.
    - Make the tough decisions
        - Decide who should no longer remain in your leadership team
        - Be dispassionate in having the right people in place
        - Be Compassionate about how the tough decisions affect the people
    - Build your team and coordinate an organization of teams
        - People's satisfaction at work is also determined by whom they work with.
        - Ensure that your team has one or more common and compelling goals.

        - Encourage your team of direct reports to interact and collaborate
        - Reinforce that all decisions and actions must be towards moving the organization towards its strategic goals
        - Push as much information to all your teams.
- Harnessing Performance feedback
    - Give constructive, candid and timely feedback. Otherwise, people won't know whether their efforts are working or not.
    - Leaders giving feedback is critical as it sets the tone for feedback and learning throughout the organization.
    - Few principles-
        - Feedback is a business activity(not personal) thats important for the health of the organization.
        - Frame the feedback discussion as a problem solving exercise, instead of telling them to do differently.
        - Base the feedback on data and not on subjective impressions.
- Fostering learning and development
    - Put your time into the development of top talent - by participating in creating and reviewing training and development plans.
    - Participate in events, programs and training sessions with your team members
    - Force the people into stretch assignments and projects where they can build new skills and work on fixing their gaps
    - Rotate people through different parts of the organization
    - Ask people to work together to achieve common goals.
- Sharing your incentives philosophy
    - Make your incentive philosophy explicit. Make your people aware of what behaviours and outcomes are rewarded.
    - Performance assessment should be a 2D matrix of behaviours and results.
    - Everyone in the organization need to know this philosophy and how it applies to them.
- Shaping a culture of executing your strategy
    - Sum of attitudes, beliefs, customs and behaviours shaped over time.
    - The culture should be aligned with the vision and strategy
    - Define your cultural goals, after having a candid assessment of the existing one
    - Take action to move the organization towards the cultural goals
        - Recruit the right kind of people and let go of people who don't fit in.
        - Give feedback on cultural fitness as well
        - Influence the organization through small, subtle and symbolic actions.
        - As part of career development, ask your top talents to act on the cultural goals.
        - People exhibit the desired cultural behaviours when they see them to be rewarded and recognized.

## Focusing on results
- When the high performance and results are the only expected outcome, its makes the team and the leaders think and work differently and discover new opportunities which wouldn't have been the case otherwise.
- Four elements the create a focus on results:
    - Setting high performance goals
        - the ability to establish high performance expectations may be the most universally underdeveloped leadership skill
        - High performance is only possible when the expectations are ratcheted up
    - Holding people accountable
        - Evaluate people based on the results, not for effort. Otherwise it becomes acceptable to try hard and deliver only mediocre results.
        - Help people overcome the barriers in their work
    - Reducing organization complexity. Examples are-
        - Organizational or Structural design that get in the way of getting things done
        - Product proliferation
        - Outdated processes
        - Managerial behaviors that get in the way
    - Building capabilities while growing results
        - Most effective change in organizations comes from bottom up experiments in an iterative process
        - Managers and their people learn new capabilities and experience success
        - Spread the new approaches to others.
    -  Maintaining organizational discipline
        - Get the right metrics
            - Are we focusing on the right questions
            - Does our data tell a story
            - Does our data help us to look ahead rather than behind
            - Do we have a mix of quantitative and qualitative data
        - Set an operational review cadence
        - Lead a candid dialogue at operational reviews
            - Ask tough and direct questions
            - Ask questions that forces people to think differently+

## Innovating for the future
A culture of innovation increases the chance and sustained performance of an organization over time. There are two villains for a sustained business success-
- External: Market shifts, New technologies and global economic shocks
- Internal: Complacency, Inward focus and arrogance

Its important to instill a sense of dissatisfaction of the status quo. Four elements for an organization to be focussed on innovation-
- Balancing the present and the future
- Getting ready for the future
- Shaping the future
- Building a future focussed culture

### Building the present and future
While its challenging, leaders must preserve and improve the current/core business and at the same time, create opportunities for growth. For doing so-
- Create bandwidth to focus on the future
- Take a portfolio approach to innovation

### Getting ready for the future
Prepare for the future in terms of resources and information about opportunities and threats to guide the idea generation and experimentation. Important facets of this-
- Build current surplus to fund the future
- Incremental innovation based on the current offerings(or its variations), by expanding them to new markets or putting them to use in new scenarios.
- Free up resources(or cash) by destroying products or business units
- Scan the horizon for breakthrough innovation. As a leader -
    - Expand the awareness of new and ambitious possibilities, new technologies, new social or economic paradigms, cutting edge ideas in other industries
    - Be bold and creative
    - Engage with customers, partners, academic and industry experts
    - Talk to people throughout your organization

### Shaping the future
Innovation should be an intentional approach to evolve the organization toward a significantly new value proposition and relationship with customers while learning and sharpening about the value proposition along the way.<br><br>
**Disruptive Innovation**<br>
A process by which a smaller competitors quietly develops a new business model and suddenly shifts the competitive dynamics of an entire industry and its well established companies.<br>
The best approach towards protecting oneself from disruptive innovation is to develop disruptive ideas yourself. This is possible by setting up a separate team or a business unit focussed on just that.<br>
Another approach to deal with disrupting innovation is to partner with such companies(or buy them).<br><br>
**Lean Innovation**<br>
Lean approach focuses on advancing, changing and discarding innovative ideas. The core of the approach is rapid experimentation with real customers on a smaller scale and getting feedback from them. This can help to confirm the idea, pivot to a better idea, reconfigure it or drop it altogether(a fail-fast approach).<br>
Real innovation and sustained value is derived only from customers that are willing to buy the product or utilize the service and its important to engage with them upfront.<br><br>
**Encourage controlled failure**<br>
Failure is a necessary component of learning. If organizations don't try things(that have a higher chance of failure), they can never create new forms of value. Adopt the lean approach of experimentation and fail fast.<br><br>

### Build a future focussed culture
An innovative culture is where the employees are intellectually curious, open to change, resilient and flexible. They learn from failure and learn new ways of working. They are future oriented and think in the long term. Initiatives for building such a culture-
- Building Innovation metrics
- Appointing Innovation champions
- Communication campaigns
- Innovation workshops
- Innovation fund
- Innovation challenges
- Innovation network across the company<br>
As a leader of the organization, participate actively in these initiatives to spread the culture of innovation.
