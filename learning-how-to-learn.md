# Learning how to learn

- When you start a new chapter, go on a picture walk. Check out the pictures, the headings and captions. It gives your brain an idea of what's coming.
- There are two ways of thinking that we need to alternate between to learn well:
    - Focused mode: That's when you pay close attention
    - Diffused mode: That's when your mind is not thinking anything in particular. 
- The diffused mode helps you make imaginative connections between ideas and creativity pops out. So take breaks to get new problem solving perspectives.
- Stop procrastinating. Its stressful. Just get started on the activity and that will make it easier after sometime.
- Use the Pomodoro technique: Shutdown all distractions and focus for 25 minutes and reward yourself at the end.
- Active Recall: Actively recall key ideas that you are learning so that it sticks in your memory better and becomes a great way to learn them better.
- The Three key steps to powerful reading:
    - Picture walk
    - Read slowly with care
    - Use active recall
- The brain is made of billions of neurons which forms links with each other through small electrical shocks. Learning and practicing makes these links stronger. The neurons are like a clay mold and new brain links can be formed. This is called neuroplasticity.
- Metaphors help in the learning process because of *neural reuse theory* as the new learning will be based on brain links formed due to metophors, which we can easily connect with already.
- The more you learn, practice and sleep, the more you grow new dendrites and synaptic links. Stronger links and more links. The dendrites and links start fading if we don't revisit(recall) the learning or if we don't practice regularly. Its also recommended to space out learning over multiple and continuous days for the dendrites to grow and strengthen during the sleep.
- Two types of memory:
    - Working memory:  deals with information that we have in our mind right now. *Focus* helps us to acquire and retain information longer in the working memory.
    - Long term memory: The information in our brain which are stored long term. Each piece of information is a set of brain links. The long term memory can never be filled.
- The long term memory has two parts:
    - Semantic(Facts)
    - Episodic(Pictures): Easier for the brain to store information in this format
- Five tips for remembering things:
    - Focus
    - Practice
    - Visualize
    - Store it with an anchor(another thing you already know)
    - Recall actively
- Memory palace technique: Place things your want to remember in familiar locations or directions. Make the things silly and add some movement if possible. This helps in remembering because our brain is better with places and directions(visuo-spatial).
- Other memory techniques:
    - Make up songs
    - Make up metaphors
    - Take good notes(preferably hand written)
    - Imagine you are the information that you are trying to remember
    - Teach someone else or a rubber duck
    - Associate numbers with well known shapes or characters
- Brain links get stronger by practice and not just by understanding. Multiple brain links can be connected with each other as well.
- *Cognitive load*: The mental effort to keep things in the working memory. When you are learning, your working memory can only hold so much. So its important to *focus* completely during learning.
- The starting steps to learning can be hardest and becomes enjoyable only after gaining mastery(or creating the brain links). So start learning, be patient and keep working on it.
- Hang out with people with interests you want to imbibe, that will help you have many more ideas.
- Hippocampus is the part of the brain important for remembering facts and events and produces neurons to remember things. Exercise produces BDNF which keeps these neurons strong and healthy. Exercises is the food for your brain and helps in generating new ideas.
- Two ideas behind creating brain-links:
    - Deliberate practice: Learning new and difficult things. *Lazy learning* is learning things that you know already.
    - Interleaving: Practicing different aspects and techniques of a skill
- Study in different places so that your brain does not fixate on a location when learning a specific thing
- Use all your senses for learning - hearing, reading, seeing and feeling(if possible).
- *Eat your frogs first*: Get started with the difficult or unpleasant things first.
- Set a quitting time for your learning.
- Think like a learning scientist of your own learning process. Find out what works and what doesn't. You can keep notes of when you did something well or when you didn't and find out what helped and what didn't help.
- If you have a poor working memory, that might enable you to learn more richly and deeply. It might make you more creative and also help you simplify topics more elegantly to be stored in your long term memory.
- Its always better to take notes by hand as it helps to create the brain links better. Writing strengthens brain links.
- It can be beneficial to learn other alternate subjects/skills as well as that will help you learn your main subjects/skills better.
- Tips for better learning:
    - Broaden your passions and learn about multiple things
    - Be persistent with your learning and take breaks to use your diffuse mode effectively 
    - When you make mistakes, admit it, correct it and flexibly change your mind.
