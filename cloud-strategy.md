# Cloud Strategy

Adopting a cloud strategy is like a change in lifestyle or moving to another country. We have to make significant adaptations to the new conditions. Some of them are -
- Budgeting is elastic, instead of being predicted
- Shoot for global optimization, instead of local
- Operating model is apps and infra together.
- Resilience is built through automation
- Scope is the whole platform instead of component
- Compliance is transparent instead of being controlling


### First Derivative
Digital transformation is not about making digital clones of offline processes. Digital companies redefine the whole business model by leveraging technology. How do they find the right business model though? They do not have the luxury of a well defined target state, and exist in a world of constant change. Digital companies embrace economies of speed(by quick experimentation, learning and course correction) and not scale.

### Wishful Thinking
Wishing for things is free. Two things help us translate wishes into reality - Strategy and Goals. Some points on this -
- Strategies will help you in making your wishes come true.
- Goals will help you know whether you are heading in the right direction and making good progress.
- Strategy is also about a series of meaningful decisions. 
- Strategy is also defined by what you're not doing.

<br>

Three elements of a strategy -
- You need to set priorities
- You need to balance your plan with opportunities that might come along.
- You need to allocate resources along with your strategy.

### Principles
Consistency in decision models are possible through principles. The principles are derived from the strategy. Principles are defining principles -
- If the opposite of a principle is nonsense, then its not a good principle.
- Principles that include product names or specific architectures, it runs the risk of decisions wanting to be elevated to principles.
- Principles should pass the test of time
- Principles should employ parallelism, meaning they should use the same grammatical constructs.
- Principles should be memorable
- Should only be a handful of principles, not more than that.
<br>

**High Level Principles**-
- Multicloud doesn't mean uniform cloud
- Waiting for cloud evolution can be a viable strategy

**Specific High Level Principles**-
- Use before reuse
- Design from front to back
<br>

Capabilities != Benefit<br>
Not every feature translates into value or benefit for the organization. The best feature or tool is the one which suits your current state or level. Organization should select those products that will help them grow to the next level. Organizations cannot make giant leads forward ahead of competition based on adoption of certain tools, thats a myth.

## Organizing for the cloud

Cloud migration is similar to outsourcing, but has the following advantages -
- Full control
- Transparency
- Short term commitments
- Evolution
- Economics

The cloud manages to draw a precise line between scale optimized implementation and speed optimized business plan. The cloud operating model works best when each team is given end to end control and responsibility over products or functional areas. These are the product teams which cuts across all layers of the system architecture.<br>

**Engineering Productivity Teams**<br>
Teams which maximize the productivity of the product teams by building the common elements of the products such as delivery pipelines or log processing. What they do -
- enable teams to accomplish more
- contribute to customer visible business work
- let the product team still own the development and operations of their product

The Cloud Center of Excellence could be a failure model as they might become a bottleneck for inbound requests and more likely to disable the organization than enable it.

**Retain/Re-Skill/Replace/Retire**<br>
The 4 Rs of people transformation or preparing your workforce for the cloud journey-
- Retain: Your existing developers can easily adapt to the development for the cloud
- Reskill: should be the first option in this transformation to train the existing people on cloud computing.
- Replace: For those people who cannot be replaced, but this might be required.
- Retire: For those position which are not needed anymore.

Its most likely that your organization already has the people you need for the cloud journey and all they need to be is given an opportunity and re-skilled if required. Create an ecosystem where the best people can contribute their best. Do not re-label, that is give new title names to existing positions/people. 

Its also not a good method to hire a leader from another digital company as they might know the target picture, but not the path leading to it. Instead, look for the following traits-
- Stamina: Someone who has shown the stamina to see a transformation journey from start to end.
- Enterprise experience: Exposure to enterprise systems and environments
- Teacher: They know how to take you where you want to be.
- Engine room: Ability to work in the engine rooms of the enterprise
- Vendor neutral: Look out for candidates who are looking to drive the transformation through product investment alone.

**Enterprise Architecture in the Cloud**<br>
Large enterprises include a team labeled "Enterprise Architecture" as part of the central IT governance. They should focus on the following tasks in an enterprise's cloud journey -
- Inform Business leadership - Separate hype from reality and keep the business leadership informed.
- Link Business, Organizations and IT - Create a holistic view of the architecture and bring all stakeholders together, explaining the why and what.
- Establish guidelines and enable adoption

*Value Delivery Loop*<br>
Developers code -> IT Engineers run software -> Product owners create new features<br>
This loop should spin faster to create value at a fast rate. The EA should work outside the loop and create a two way connection between this loop and other stakeholders such as Business, Cloud Providers and IT Stakeholders.

## Moving to the Cloud

Reasons for moving to the cloud -
- Cost - This can be an advantage only when the elastic pricing is used along with transparency and automation.
- Uptime
- Scalability
- Performance
- Velocity
- Security
- Insight
- Transparency

Organizations should take an application centric view on their cloud strategy, instead of a infrastructure point of view. The application centric view focuses on speeding up software delivery, through increased automation. Carrying the existing processes and systems into the cloud will get you another data center, but not a cloud and that doesn't make a mark.

*Running other's software is a bad deal* due to the following reasons -
- You pay for the hardware
- Installation is cumbersome
- If something breaks, you're guilty until proven innocent
- You can't make changes when you need them
The alternative is Software as a Service where the vendor runs the applications for you.

Consider the following recurring themes in the cloud strategy -
- Onboarding
- Hybrid clouds
- Virtual Private Cloud
- Legacy or Monolithic Applications
- Cost recovery

NIST published a useful definition of cloud computing listed below -
- On demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid Elasticity
- Measured Service

A few considerations for Enterprise Cloud -
- Calibrate expectations - Carrying your enterprise baggage to the cloud won't transform anything
- Bring the cloud to you - Bring elements of the cloud operating model to your environment
- Measurable goals - Establish clear goals for the cloud migration and be clear why you are going to the cloud
- Segmentation - Some parts of the applications can go straight to the cloud.

### Phases of Cloud Migration

**Planning and Staffing**<br>
A checklist prior to the migration-
- Size up the migration
- Clarify the motivations and goals
- Define success and metrics
- Get stakeholder buy-in

The following are the critical roles for a cloud migration -
- Executive sponsor - who gets budgets and resources
- Chief Architect - Mmkes key technology decisions and goals
- Program Manager - handles communication and schedule

Responsibilities of a Program Manager -
- Keeping track of the migration schedule and deliverables
- Applying influence where needed to get the execution going across various teams
- Coordinating the flow of information between various parties
- Publishing regular updates on the migration progress
- Highlighting risks and important decision points to the executive sponsor and chief architect

**Execution**<br>
- Discovery - Gathering information about the existing environment
- Automation and Federation 
    - Automation involves building software to provision, deploy, and verify components in the new environment.
    - Federated Execution - Greater responsibility to individual teams, giving them the freedom on how to deliver the migration outcomes. This won't work for teams don't manage their own infrastructure
- Training - Teams should be sufficiently trained for the new environment

**Validation**<br>
Classification of validations -
- Environment validation - stress test the environment whether it meets the performance and scale expectations
- Cost validation - Benchmark the actual cost of operations against the projected cost
- Business Goals validation - Validate business goals such as improved security, agility and availability

### Plotting the Execution
The migration can be done in two directions -
- Up - This is same as modernizing the application 
- Out - This is migrating the application or its components to the cloud

The execution or migration should be a combination of both directions. The modernization can occur along multiple dimensions:
- Platform(Iaas -> PaaS --> FaaS)
- Structure(Monolith -> Microservices)
- Deployment(Manual -> Automated)

The decision model of bucketizing for applications -
- Applications that you didn't build(commercial applications)
- Applications that someone built for you(System integrations)
- Applications built in-house

Beware of proxy metrics such as number of applications  or servers migrated. Instead focus on metrics which indicate value.
