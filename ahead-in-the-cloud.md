# Ahead in the Cloud

Cloud computing is the provisioning of IT resources over the Internet on a pay per use model. 

There are usually four stages of cloud adoption -
1. **Projects**<br>
Identifying the right projects for the initial migration, ones which are valuable to business and also has a high learning potential.
2. **Foundation**
Create a cross functional and cross organizational team which can create (cloud-first)reference architectures and continuous deployment tools which interests business units to adopt them.
3. **Migration**<br>
Five phases of the migration process:<br>
    1. *Opportunity evaluation* - Business case for migration
    2. *Portfolio discovery and planning* - Understand the current environment and its dependencies better
    3. *Application design* - Move the focus of the migration to the individual application and use the six strategies of migration applications
    4. *Migration and Validation* - Have a strategy of continuous improvement and starting with a low complex application for migration and strategy for testing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six Strategies for migrating applications:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. *Rehosting* - Lift and Shift. Good for steady state applications or making the initial move to Cloud before re-architecting them to be more cloud native.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. *Replatforming* - Lift, Tinker and Shift<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. *Repurchasing* - Move to a SaaS platform<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. *Re-architecting* - Rebuild using cloud-native components/technologies<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. *Retire* - Get rid of the application<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. *Retain* - Do nothing or revisit later

4. **Reinvention**
