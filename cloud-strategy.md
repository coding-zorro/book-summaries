# Cloud Strategy

Adopting a cloud strategy is like a change in lifestyle or moving to another country. We have to make significant adaptations to the new conditions. Some of them are -
- Budgeting is elastic, instead of being predicted
- Shoot for global optimization, instead of local
- Operating model is apps and infra together.
- Resilience is built through automation
- Scope is the whole platform instead of component
- Compliance is transparent instead of being controlling

Digital transformation is not about making digital clones of offline processes. Its about redefining the whole business model by leveraging technology. Digital companies do not have the luxury of a well defined target state, they exist in a world of constant change
