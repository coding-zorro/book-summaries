# Cloud Strategy

Adopting a cloud strategy is like a change in lifestyle or moving to another country. We have to make significant adaptations to the new conditions. Some of them are -
- Budgeting is elastic, instead of being predicted
- Shoot for global optimization, instead of local
- Operating model is apps and infra together.
- Resilience is built through automation
- Scope is the whole platform instead of component
- Compliance is transparent instead of being controlling


### First Derivative
Digital transformation is not about making digital clones of offline processes. Digital companies redefine the whole business model by leveraging technology. How do they find the right business model though? They do not have the luxury of a well defined target state, and exist in a world of constant change. Digital companies embrace economies of speed(by quick experimentation, learning and course correction) and not scale.

### Wishful Thinking
Wishing for things is free. Two things help us translate wishes into reality - Strategy and Goals. Some points on this -
- Strategies will help you in making your wishes come true.
- Goals will help you know whether you are heading in the right direction and making good progress.
- Strategy is also about a series of meaningful decisions. 
- Strategy is also defined by what you're not doing.

Three elements of a strategy -
- You need to set priorities
- You need to balance your plan with opportunities that might come along.
- You need to allocate resources along with your strategy.

### Principles
Consistency in decision models are possible through principles. The principles are derived from the strategy. Principles are defining principles -
- If the opposite of a principle is nonsense, then its not a good principle.
- Principles that include product names or specific architectures, it runs the risk of decisions wanting to be elevated to principles.
- Principles should pass the test of time
- Principles should employ parallelism, meaning they should use the same grammatical constructs.
- Principles should be memorable
- Should only be a handful of principles, not more than that.

**High Level Principles**-
- Multicloud doesn't mean uniform cloud
- Waiting for cloud evolution can be a viable strategy

**Specific High Level Principles**-
- Use before reuse
- Design from front to back

Capabilities != Benefit<br>
Not every feature translates into value or benefit for the organization. The best feature or tool is the one which suits your current state or level. Organization should select those products that will help them grow to the next level. Organizations cannot make giant leads forward ahead of competition based on adoption of certain tools, thats a myth.
