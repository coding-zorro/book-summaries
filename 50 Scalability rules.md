### **Chapter 1: Reduce the Equation**

1. **Don’t Overengineer the Solution**
   Simplify architecture to make scaling, debugging, and maintenance easier. Avoid unnecessary complexity that slows you down.
2. **Design Scale into the Solution (D-I-D Process)**
   Build in scalability from the very beginning rather than retrofitting it later. It’s cost-effective and avoids awkward rearchitecting.
3. **Simplify the Solution Three Times Over**
   After creating an architecture, cut out redundancy or unnecessary components. Keep repeating this refinement until only essentials remain.
4. **Reduce DNS Lookups**
   Minimize DNS resolutions to cut latency per request. Reduce network overhead and speed up web page loads.
5. **Reduce Objects Where Possible**
   Too many files (images, scripts, styles) add overhead. Consolidate assets to reduce requests and improve performance.
6. **Use Homogeneous Networks**
   Stick with standard infrastructure across services. Consistency reduces complexity and failure modes.

### **Chapter 2: Distribute Your Work**

7. **Design to Clone or Replicate Things (X-Axis)**
   Scale by replicating the same service across multiple servers. Cloning ensures redundancy and helps balance traffic.
8. **Design to Split Different Things (Y-Axis)**
   Break up functions into isolated services (e.g., auth, billing, content). This separation prevents one slow service from affecting others.
9. **Design to Split Similar Things (Z-Axis)**
   Partition data or workload across segments (e.g., user vs. region). This reduces hotspots and scales horizontally further.

### **Chapter 3: Design to Scale Out Horizontally**

10. **Design Your Solution to Scale Out, Not Just Up**
    Use many small machines rather than bigger expensive ones. Horizontal scaling is more cost-effective and resilient.
11. **Use Commodity Systems (Goldfish Not Thoroughbreds)**
    Choose inexpensive, reliable hardware over high-end specialized machines. It's more cost-efficient and easier to scale.
12. **Scale Out Your Hosting Solution**
    Don’t concentrate hosting; distribute across multiple servers or zones. This reduces risk and improves availability.
13. **Design to Leverage the Cloud**
    Take advantage of cloud elasticity for scaling resources up and down. It’s flexible and allows rapid adaptation to load changes.

---

### **Chapter 4: Use the Right Tools**

14. **Use Databases Appropriately**
    Apply the right database for the right use case (SQL, NoSQL, search, etc.). The wrong match creates performance and scalability burdens.
15. **Firewalls, Firewalls Everywhere!**
    Segment and protect each boundary with firewall rules. Multiple layers of security help contain failures and threats.
16. **Actively Use Log Files**
    Logs are more than record-keeping—they’re diagnostic gold. Monitor and analyze logs proactively to detect and respond to issues fast.

---

### **Chapter 5: Get Out of Your Own Way**

17. **Don’t Check Your Work**
    Avoid verifying a write by immediately reading it back—it wastes resources. Trust the write operation unless absolutely necessary.
18. **Stop Redirecting Traffic**
    Unnecessary redirects add network hops and latency. Route requests directly for quicker responses.
19. **Relax Temporal Constraints**
    Don’t demand instant responses for non-critical tasks. Asynchronous processing can smooth out spikes and reduce load.

---

### **Chapter 6: Use Caching Aggressively**

20. **Leverage Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
    Offload assets to edge servers near users—CDNs reduce latency and server load.
21. **Use Expires Headers**
    Explicitly tell clients how long they can cache resources. This avoids repeated requests for unchanged content.
22. **Cache Ajax Calls**
    Many API responses are static or change infrequently—cache them to reduce server processing.
23. **Leverage Page Caches**
    Whole-page caching delivers repeated content instantly. Ideal for high-traffic, largely static pages.
24. **Utilize Application Caches**
    Cache computations or rendering inside the app layer to avoid reprocessing.
25. **Make Use of Object Caches**
    Store frequently accessed objects in a fast key-value store. This eliminates repeated complex object assembly.
26. **Put Object Caches on Their Own “Tier”**
    Isolate the cache layer (e.g., Redis cluster). Dedicated resources prevent cache pressure from impacting application performance.

### **Chapter 7: Learn from Your Mistakes**

27. **Learn Aggressively**
    Treat failures as learning opportunities. Identify root causes and fix them fast.
28. **Don’t Rely on QA to Find Mistakes**
    Shift testing earlier in development. Preventing issues early saves time over post-production QA.
29. **Failing to Design for Rollback Is Designing for Failure**
    Plan for failure and rollback as first-class features. A solid rollback path prevents catastrophic updates.

### **Chapter 8: Database Rules**

30. **Remove Business Intelligence from Transaction Processing**
    Don’t run heavy BI queries on transactional databases. Offload analytics to data warehouses.
31. **Be Aware of Costly Relationships**
    Deep relational queries and joins can be expensive. Model data to reduce relational complexity where practical.
32. **Use the Right Type of Database Lock**
    Granular locks (row-level vs. table-level) balance concurrency and consistency. Choose the right one for your workload.
33. **Pass on Using Multiphase Commits**
    Two-phase commits scale poorly in distributed systems. Opt for eventual consistency or simpler coordination.
34. **Try Not to Use "Select for Update"**
    Row-level locking stifles throughput. Use optimistic concurrency where possible.
35. **Don’t Select Everything**
    Only retrieve needed fields—not entire rows or objects. Minimizing data payload improves performance.

---

### **Chapter 9: Design for Fault Tolerance and Graceful Failure**

36. **Design Using Fault-Isolative “Swim Lanes”**
    Segment services to contain failure and protect unrelated components. Swim lanes limit blast radius.
37. **Never Trust Single Points of Failure**
    Replicate all critical components. Redundancy ensures resilience.
38. **Avoid Putting Systems in Series**
    Independent pipelines avoid bottlenecks; serial dependencies compound failure risk.
39. **Ensure That You Can Wire On and Off Features**
    Use feature toggles to enable or disable features dynamically. This lets you manage rollouts and faults gracefully.

---

### **Chapter 10: Avoid or Distribute State**

40. **Strive for Statelessness**
    Stateless services are easy to scale and recover. They treat each request independently.
41. **Maintain Sessions in the Browser When Possible**
    Offload session state to clients (e.g., via tokens). This avoids server memory and scalability issues.
42. **Make Use of a Distributed Cache for States**
    When sessions are needed server-side, store them in a distributed cache. Shared state survivors across restarts and scale-out.

---

### **Chapter 11: Asynchronous Communication and Message Buses**

43. **Communicate Asynchronously as Much as Possible**
    Async messaging decouples components and absorbs spikes. It instantaneously smooths load.
44. **Ensure That Your Message Bus Can Scale**
    Messaging systems should support growing load. Design for volume, latency, and redundancy.
45. **Avoid Overcrowding Your Message Bus**
    Don’t flood topics with unnecessary or verbose content. Filter and consolidate messaging for efficiency.

---

### **Chapter 12: Miscellaneous Rules**

46. **Be Wary of Scaling through Third Parties**
    External dependencies can bottleneck your scalability. Use fallback or caching to mitigate.
47. **Purge, Archive, and Cost-Justify Storage**
    Old or unused data adds storage cost and slows operations. Archive or delete intelligently.
48. **Partition Inductive, Deductive, Batch, and User Interaction (OLTP) Workloads**
    Separate workloads by type—batch vs. real-time vs. user interaction. Partitioning streamlines performance.
49. **Design Your Application to Be Monitored**
    Visibility is essential. Plan metrics, logs, and alerts from the start.
50. **Be Competent**
    Invest in knowledge and people—not just tools. Effective scale grows from skilled teams.
